Purpose: To create a simple recreational code generator,

- I'm tired of creating the same files over and over again every time I want to
  start a fun recreational project.

  The idea is that I just send in a piece of "code" - like a script that will give my compiler
  instuctions on how to generate the code.

Plan:
    For now, lets just create example code trmeplates that I want it to generate.
